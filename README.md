Sonder: the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.

We want to create a space where individuals can freely express positive emotions for others, without the mediation of a third party. To do this, we created Sonder. It is a website where individuals on campus can write compliments for other students anonymously. In this way, we hope others will share their experiences, connections, and stories and inspire others to do so as well, promoting a positive environment. 

We used Blockstack as a decentralized platform and Radix to allow every user to see all posts on the website and create a backend. We used React with Rebass for the front end. Finally, we deployed our app on Heroku.
